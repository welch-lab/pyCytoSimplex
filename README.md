"CytoSimplex" is a Python module that creates simplex plot showing similarity between single-cells and terminals represented by clusters of cells.
RNA velocity can be added as another layer of information.

For R users, we have an R package [CytoSimplex](https://github.com/welch-lab/CytoSimplex) that provides the same functionalities.

We have build a [documentation website](https://pycytosimplex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for:
- [Detailed instruction for installation](https://pycytosimplex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
- [Walkthrough example from loading data to creating different simplex visualization](https://pycytosimplex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example/index.html)
